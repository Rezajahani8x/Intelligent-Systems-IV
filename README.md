# Intelligent-Systems-IV
In this project, different neural networks with different structures are implemented for cifar10 dataset. After changing the hyperparameters and testing different structures, the optimal neural network is chosen.  Also a transfer learning model on EfficientNet is implemented.

- Section 1
    * In this section a neural network is theoratically implemented.
    * Weights and biases are calculated and optimized via backpropagation.

- Section 2
    * This section has 2 different sub-sections.
    * Initialy, a MLP model is implemented and trained.
    * In each part, different hyperparameters change for the aim of figuring the optimal configuration.
    * In the second sub-section, convolutional layers are inserted in the beginning of the network.
    * Alternatively, different hyperparameters are tested for a satisfactory performance.

- Section 3
    * In this section, the EfficientNetB0 is loaded.
    * Some processes and evaluations and slight alterations are performed on this Neural Network.
    * In the end, the model is trained with new dataset, preparing a transfer learning model.
